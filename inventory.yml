# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in your Git repository, and there should be a link from /etc/ansible/hosts:
#   /etc/ansible/hosts -> /path/to/myAnsibleProject/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
